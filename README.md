# The Fake Bank

## Description
This is a front end, single page application demo. You can create an account, login, deposit, withdraw, and view the site's data. Site data includes the users and transactions.

## How To Run
This exercise can be run by forking the repository and cloning it to your machine. If you don't have npm installed, you can get it by installing [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Run 'npx http-server' from the command line to run a temporary [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server). The output will let you know what port the servier is listenting on (ex. http://127.0.0.1:8080). Hit CTRL-C to stop the server when finished.
