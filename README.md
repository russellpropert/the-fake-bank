# The Fake Bank

## Description
This is a front end, single page application demo. You can create an account, login, deposit, withdraw, and view the site's data. Site data includes the users and transactions.

## How To Run
This exercise can be run by forking the repository and cloning it to your machine. If you don't have npm installed, you can get it by installing node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Run 'npx http-server' from the command line to run a temporary http-server or install http-server as a global command by running 'npm install --global http-server' (https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server). Run 'http-server' to start a server. Run 'http-server -c-1' to prevent the browser from caching if you want to make changes. You can then access the page by going to localhost:8080 in your web browser.
